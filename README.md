<img width="154" alt="截圖_2022-12-20_上午3 58 40-removebg-preview (2)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8797471/209278505-ae4d89df-247e-4273-a835-c1ee3cd80592.png">
Welcome to the repository for SG-API (SG: SpatialGraph), a 3D search engine designed not to answer your question, but rather, to explore what questions you should be asking.
SG-API allows users to navigate and explore a virtual 3D environment and discover new learning materials and resources.

Please also check out SG-API's latest [Medium article released in December of 2022](https://sethhasi.medium.com/sg-api-3d-exploratory-search-engine-for-the-next-generation-learner-ideation-stage-dcf368dc9e6c) that explains the background story of our team and the opportunities and benefits of this project.

## Features
1. A **3D search engine** displaying free and open data
2. Large data **"clusters"**, where each cluster represents an individual query
3. Smaller **"sub-clusters"** within each cluster that are grouped by AI based on similar characteristics
4. Arrangements of **search history** based on AI-calculated query similarity
5. **Explainable AI** that discusses the logic behind (5.1) how each sub-cluster is formed, (5.2) the meaning of the distance calculations between each query/large cluster, and (5.3) how the AI understands the meaning of your query
