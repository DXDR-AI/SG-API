# SG-API: 3D Exploratory Search Engine for the Next-Generation Learner
Welcome to the repository for SG-API (SG: SpatialGraph), a 3D search engine designed not to answer your question, but rather, to explore what questions you should be asking.
SG-API allows users to navigate and explore a virtual 3D environment and discover new learning materials and resources.

This repository contains the code and resources for SpatialGraph API, as well as additional materials and information related to the project.

Please also check out SG-API's latest [Medium article released in December of 2022](https://sethhasi.medium.com/sg-api-3d-exploratory-search-engine-for-the-next-generation-learner-ideation-stage-dcf368dc9e6c) that explains the background story of our team and the opportunities and benefits of this project.

## Features
1. A **3D search engine** displaying free and open data
2. Large data **"clusters"**, where each cluster represents an individual query
3. Smaller **"sub-clusters"** within each cluster that are grouped by AI based on similar characteristics
4. Arrangements of **search history** based on AI-calculated query similarity
5. **Explainable AI** that discusses the logic behind (5.1) how each sub-cluster is formed, (5.2) the meaning of the distance calculations between each query/large cluster, and (5.3) how the AI understands the meaning of your query

## Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions to the SG API search engine! If you have ideas for improvements or new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
